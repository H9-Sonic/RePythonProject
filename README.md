(Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling)

The AudioGUI.py file will, when opened, ask the user to input an audio file.
Upon opening the file the program will display the file name, then be able to convert the audio file to .wav.
Afterward the program will check if the audio is multi-channel and convert to one channel if so.
It then creates six plots of waveform RT60 for Low, Mid, and High frequencies as well as an additional plot.
It will also display the length of the audio in seconds, te frequency of the greatest amplitude, and the RT60 differences in seconds.
The program will also have a button to combine the low, mid and, high frequency plots into one singular plot.
