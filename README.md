# PythonProject
(Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling)

The main.py file will, when ran, ask the user to input an audio file.
Upon opening the file the program will display the file name, then be able to convert the audio file to .wav if not already.
Afterward the program will check if the audio is multi-channel and convert to one channel if so.
It then creates six plots of waveform RT60 one for Low, Mid, and High frequencies one for the combined frequency, one for waveform and one for the spectrogram.
It will also display the length of the audio in seconds, the frequency of the greatest amplitude, and the RT60 differences in seconds.
